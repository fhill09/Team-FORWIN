Pearmund Cellars Winery – Forecasting Wine Production (690 Project)
In this project, we created models using the operation research methods to strategically make decisions for maximizing the profit. The first optimization model delivered a result of maximum profit possible using the provided inventory data and the variable constraints. The result was promising as the numbers were comparable with the Pearmund’s sales data. The second model of revenue management focused mainly on price adjustments to locate the optimal price per bottle of the white label (regular) and the black label (premium). We were, then, able to comprehensively describe the correlation of price elasticity within the revenue management model and maximizing the profit. The Monte Carlo simulation also presented optimization of pricing, but with the changing variables factored in the model such as different bottles sold for a particular wine or a particular wine sold at different prices. The simulation provided the minimum and maximum profit as well as the mean profit at given metrics.
